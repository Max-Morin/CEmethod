# CEmethod
The package implements the noisy cross-entropy method for optimization.
See http://ie.technion.ac.il/CE/files/papers/Learning%20Tetris%20Using%20the%20Noisy%20Cross-Entropy%20Method.pdf for an intro. This package was made considering functions that are expensive to evaluate. When the function to optimize is cheap, there will be considerable communication overhead. The subpackage tetris shows an application to a complicated stochastic problem.

TODO: More simple example functions.
